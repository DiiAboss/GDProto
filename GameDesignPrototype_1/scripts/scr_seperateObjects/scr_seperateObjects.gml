/// separate_objects.gml
/// ------------------------------------------------------------
/// Purpose: Minimalistic push-apart solver for two dynamic instances using a
///          circular-ish radius derived from sprite widths. Intended for soft
///          separation (no tunneling fix), e.g., crowding units.
/// How it fits:
///  - Call when two actors overlap to nudge them apart symmetrically.
///  - Uses `obj_wall` as a static blocker; respects walls per instance.
///  - Keeps math cheap: one distance check, one direction, and two half-pushes.
/// Behavior notes:
///  - Overlap test uses `sprite_width`; if sprites are non-uniform or scaled,
///    consider using collision masks or `image_xscale` adjustments upstream.
///  - If one side is blocked by a wall, only the other moves (asymmetrical push).
///  - `force` scales displacement; it is not a physics forceâ€”just a multiplier.
///  - Skips when `dist == 0` to avoid undefined direction; consider jitter
///    prevention or a random small nudge at call site if perfectly stacked.
